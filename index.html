                <p>
                    In plain words, Agile mindset is the ability to create and respond to change. <br>
                    For project management in software development, the agile methodology is a set of <strong>processes</strong> through which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organising and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s)<br>

                <h2 id="mani">Agile Manifesto</h2>
                <p>
                    The creators of the agile methodology have signed and published a manifesto that acts as guidance for all teams using Agile to develop, deliver and sustain software products across the globe.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals and interactions <strong>over</strong> processes and tools</li>
                    <li>Working software <strong>over</strong> comprehensive documentation</li>
                    <li>Customer collaboration <strong>over</strong> contract negotiation</li>
                    <li>Responding to change <strong>over</strong> following a plan</li>
                </ul>
                </p><br>

                    The manisfesto relies on <strong>12 implementation principles</strong> as follows:<br>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
                    <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
                    <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. </li>
                    <li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. </li>
                    <li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need,
                        and trust them to get the job done.</li>
                    <li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development
                        team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
                    <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                    <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
                        The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
                        </li>
                    <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
                    <li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
                        </li>
                    <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
                        </li>
                    <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
                        its behavior accordingly.</li>
                    </ol>
